1. Do i need to save the client token in a file or DB or can I simply create the thread and store it in a variable?
2. At any point do I want to end a thread when an error occurs? Do I need to handle all exceptions (Incorrect inputs)?
3. In file list, the structure is: Filename:IP:port. The enonc√© says if a file is local, no need to write the address. Can i put it if i'd like?
4. READ to client, how receive data? Display in client console the contents or download to .txt file?
5. Update file_list and PeerList of all other servers when writing file?
6. Do we need to worry about file duplicates? If a client tries to upload an existing file?
